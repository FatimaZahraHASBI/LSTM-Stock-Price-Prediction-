<b>Stock Prices Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model in Python</b><br><br>
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one type of recurrent neural network which is used to learn order dependence in sequence prediction problems. Due to its capability of storing past information, LSTM is very useful in predicting stock prices. This is because the prediction of a future stock price is dependent on the previous prices.
